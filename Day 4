It pulls from sources of code within the framework to work with other sources of code or applications of the code.
B) ASCII Character Set vs UTF 8 Charter Set vs UTF 16 Character Set
UTF-8 encodes Unicode characters into a sequence of 8-bit bytes. The standard has a capacity for over a million distinct codepoints and is a superset of all characters in widespread use today.
By comparison, ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) includes 128 character codes.
UTF-8 extends the ASCII character set to use 8-bit code points, which allows for up to 256 different characters. 
This means that UTF-8 can represent all of the printable ASCII characters, as well as the non-printable characters.
The utf16 character set is the ucs2 character set with an extension that enables encoding of supplementary characters: For a BMP character, 
utf16 and ucs2 have identical storage characteristics: same code values, same encoding, same length.
ASCII is a 7-bit character set containing 128 characters. It contains the numbers from 0-9, the upper and lower case English letters from A to Z, and some special characters. 
The character sets used in modern computers, in HTML, and on the Internet, are all based on ASCII.
C) SEO?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is the practice of orienting your website to rank higher on a search engine results page (SERP) so that you receive more traffic.
The aim is typically to rank on the first page of Google results for search terms that mean the most to your target audience.
